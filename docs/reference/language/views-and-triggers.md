# Views and triggers

```eye
view idleWorlds = World.all
  |> filter(fn w: w.phase == Running && w.players == {})

@on(enters(idleWorlds))
job sleepWhenIdle(w: Ref(World)) { sleep!(20 min) }   # full version in the tour
```

- A view is a named pipeline over entities. The runtime keeps it up to date as entity transactions
  commit.
- `enters(view)` starts one run per entity that begins matching; `leaves(view)` starts one per
  entity that stops matching.
- Over entity sets, pipelines compile to SQL. The same functions work on in-memory lists.
